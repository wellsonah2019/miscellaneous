Dialogue interaction choices:

from taking on projects that are out of her scope." (interaction will restart upon the end of this line -- lag may happen when re-triggering the interaction)

Dialogue interaction choices:  

Option 1: "Check on intern when it is convenient for the both of you." (wrong choice)  
"Both your time schedules may clash, and the intern may not have sufficient time to prepare for an impromptu check in session. " (interaction will restart upon the end of this line -- lag may happen when re-triggering the interaction)  

Option 2: "Include intentional Bi-weekly check in sessions" (correct choice)  
"Great choice! Having a scheduled time to meet your intern can provide sufficient time for both to catch up. This also allows you and your intern to have better time management with proper scheduling."  

Option 3: "Check on your intern during team lunches or department meetings." (wrong choice)  
"Although this may be alright, your intern may be reluctant or uncomfortable to share about her personal experiences openly in front of other colleagues. Hence, this may result in the intern giving a patronizing response."
